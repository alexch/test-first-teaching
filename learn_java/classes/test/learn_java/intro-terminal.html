    <h1>Introduction to Test-First Training - Terminal Instructions</h1>

    <blockquote>
      THESE INSTRUCTIONS NEED TO BE REVISED -- IntroTest0.java is no longer a thing
    </blockquote>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Open a command prompt.
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Change directories to the "intro" module.
        <pre>cd intro</pre>
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Look at the two test files in the directory.
        <pre>(IntroTest0.java and IntroTest1.java)</pre>
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to compile the first test using javac, the Java Compiler.
        <pre>javac IntroTest0.java</pre>
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        This should fail!  You will get an error message that looks
        something like this:
        <pre>
$ javac IntroTest0.java
IntroTest0.java:5: cannot resolve symbol
symbol  : class Intro
location: class IntroTest0
        Intro x = new Intro();
        ^
IntroTest0.java:5: cannot resolve symbol
symbol  : class Intro
location: class IntroTest0
        Intro x = new Intro();
                      ^
	</pre>

        This is the Java compiler telling you that you need an object
        (class) named Intro.
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a class named Intro.  Using your favorite text editor,
        make a file called "Intro.java" (capitalization <b>is very
        important</b> in Java, so make sure the "I" is capitalized),
        in the <tt>intro</tt> directory, and put the following text
        into it:
        <pre>
public class Intro
{
}
	</pre>

        This is the way you create a "stub class", or an object that
        doesn't do anything yet.
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to compile IntroTest0.java again.
        <pre>javac IntroTest0.java</pre>
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        It should fail again!  This time, the message will be
        something like:
        <pre>
IntroTest0.java:6: cannot resolve symbol
symbol  : method getHello  ()
location: class Intro
        assertEquals("Hello", x.getHello());
                               ^
1 error
	</pre>

        This is typical for test-first development.  You may have to
        mess with your implementation code several times before the
        test will compile.  (This is partly because Java is a
        <b>strongly typed</b> language, and refuses to cooperate until
        it has a lot of information about the other classes in your
        world.)

        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Make Intro.java look like this:
        <pre>
public class Intro
{
    public String getHello()
    {
        return "Goodbye";
    }
}
	</pre>
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Compile the test one more time.
        <pre>javac IntroTest0.java</pre>
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Now run the test, using the <tt>java</tt> executable.
        <pre>java IntroTest0</pre>
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        This should also fail!  (Are you getting used to failure yet?)
        This is meant to simulate you not getting the answer right the
        first time.  You should see a message like:
        <pre>
Running IntroTest0
testHello...FAILURE
Test$AssertionFailed: Expected &lt;Hello&gt; but got &lt;Goodbye&gt;
	at Test.fail(Test.java:17)
	at Test.assertEquals(Test.java:24)
	at IntroTest0.testHello(IntroTest0.java:6)
	at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)
	at Test.runTests(Test.java:136)
	at Test.runTests(Test.java:90)
	at Test.main(Test.java:70)

OK: 0 FAILED: 1
	</pre>
        This is the Test program telling you that it tried to run the
        test case called "testHello" but it failed.  The test case was
        expecting to get back the string "Hello" but instead, it got
        the string "Goodbye".  To be helpful, it lists the exact
        source file and line number where the assertion was made.
        Look down the list of "at" lines until you see the one caused
        by your specific test case.
        <pre>at IntroTest0.testHello(IntroTest0.java:6)</pre>
        Open up this file (IntroTest0.java) and look at line 6.
        <pre>assertEquals("Hello", x.getHello());</pre>
        This gives you a big hint that the problem is somewhere inside
        the method called <tt>getHello()</tt>.
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Go back to Intro.java and fix it.
        <pre>
public class Intro
{
    public String getHello()
    {
        return "Hello";
    }
}
	</pre>
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Recompile and rerun the test. (Always be sure to recompile!)
        <pre>
javac IntroTest0.java
java IntroTest0
	</pre>
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, for extra credit, compile and run
        <tt>IntroTest1.java</tt>, and try to make it pass.
        <br /><br />
      </li>
    </ol>
