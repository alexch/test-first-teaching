    <h1>Threads</h1>


    Here we will write a simple model of a bank account.  First we will get the
    bank account working without multithreading.  Then we will create some threads
    that access the accounts.  Then the fun part begins!  Once we start running
    many threads simultaneously we will encounter some problems, which we will
    (hopefully) solve.  These solutions may lead to more problems!  Threads are fun!

    <h2>The Depositor Thread</h2>

    <p>
    The Depositor is an object that runs in a thread (in fact, it will probably
    extend java.lang.Thread) and continuously deposits a certain amount into a
    certain account.  In its constuctor it takes three parameters: the account
    to deposit into, the amount to deposit, and the number of times ro deposit
    before stopping.  In the code:

    <pre>
     1:   Thread depositor = new Depositor(account, 5, 1000);
     2:   depositor.start();
     3:   depositor.join();
    </pre>

    Line 1 creates the depositor, intending to deposit $5, 1000x. Line 2 starts
    the thread.  Line 3 (calling "Thread.join()")
    makes the test code thread wait until the depositor thread has completed.

    <p>

    Finally, in the testThreadSafe method, we spawn <b>two</b> depositor threads,
    make them run 25,000,000 times, and then check the results.  If all goes well,
    there should be
